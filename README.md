**AI (Artificial Intelligence)** refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language, and recognizing patterns. It includes:  
1. **Machine Learning (ML)** – Algorithms that improve through data (e.g., recommendation systems).  
2. **Deep Learning** – Advanced ML using neural networks (e.g., image/speech recognition).  
3. **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** – Lets AI understand/generate human language (e.g., chatbots like me!).  
4. **Robotics & Automation** – AI-powered machines performing physical tasks (e.g., self-driving cars).  

**Why it matters:** AI boosts efficiency in healthcare, finance, education, and more, but raises ethical questions about bias, privacy, and job impacts.
